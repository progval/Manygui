<h1>Anygui: Generic GUI for Python</h1>
<p class="author">Magnus Lie Hetland</p>
<p class="date">June 6th, 2002</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This version of the manual deals with
    the upcoming 0.2 release, and is not usable with the
    current release. Please consult the documentation in the
    distribution itself.</p>
<p>The <em>Python</em> standard library currently does not
    contain any platform-independent GUI packages. It is the goal of
    the <em>Anygui</em> project to change this situation. There
    are many such packages available, but none has been defined as
    <em>standard</em>, so when writing GUI programs for
    <em>Python</em>, you cannot assume that your user has the
    right package installed.</p>
<p>The problem is that declaring a GUI package as standard
    would be quite controversial. There are some packages that are
    quite commonly available, such as <em>Tkinter</em>; but it
    would not be practical to require all installations to include it,
    nor would it be desirable to require all <em>Python</em> GUI
    programs to use it, since there are many programmers who prefer
    other packages.</p>
<p>
<em>Anygui</em> tries to solve this problem in a manner
    similar to the standard <code>anydbm</code> package. There is no
    need to choose <em>one</em> package at the expense of
    all others. Instead, <em>Anygui</em> gives generic access to
    several popular packages through a simple API, which makes it
    possible to write GUI applications that work with all these
    packages. Thus, one gets a platform-independent GUI module which
    is written entirely in <em>Python</em>.</p>
<p>To get the latest <em>Anygui</em> distribution, or to
    get in touch with the developers, please visit the
    <em>Anygui</em> website:
    <code><a href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>.</p>
<h3>1.1 Design Goals</h3>
<p>
<b>A</b>. <em>Anygui</em> should be an easy
      to use GUI package which may be used to create simple graphical
      programs, or which may serve as the basis for more complex
      application frameworks.</p>
<p>
<b>B</b>. <em>Anygui</em> should be a pure
      <em>Python</em> package which serves as a front-end for as
      many as possible of the GUI packages available for
      <em>Python</em>, in a transparent manner.</p>
<p>
<b>C</b>. <em>Anygui</em> should include
      functionality needed to perform most GUI tasks, but should
      remain as simple and basic as possible.</p>
<h3>1.2 Warning</h3>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> API is currently very much in flux
      as the <em>Anygui</em> team keeps experimenting with
      it. Because of that, incompatibilities may occur between
      releases. The current release (0.2) should be regarded
      as a prototype.</p>
<h3>1.3 Tutorial</h3>
<p>There is also a short tutorial available, which is
      included in the installation (<code>doc/tutorial.txt</code>) and
      is available from the website
      (<code><a href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>).</p>
<h2>2. Installation</h2>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> package comes in the form of a
    <code>gzip</code> compressed <code>tar</code> archive, a binary
    Windows installer and as an RPM package. The Windows installer and
    RPM package should be fairly easy to install. To install the
    <code>tar</code> archive, it you will first have to uncompress the
    archive. On <em>Windows</em> this can be done with
    <em>WinZip</em>. in <em>Mac OS</em>, you can use
    <em>StuffIt Expander</em>. In <em>Unix</em>, first move to
    a directory where you'd like to put <em>Anygui</em>, and then
    do something like the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~/python$ tar xzvf anygui-0.2.tar.gz
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If your version of tar doesn't support the <code>z</code>
    switch, you can do something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~/python$ zcat anygui-0.2.tar.gz | tar xvf
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another possibility is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~/python$ gunzip anygui-0.2.tar.gz
foo:~/python$ tar -xvf anygui-0.2.tar
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>No matter which version you choose, you should end up with a
    directory named <code>anygui-0.2</code>.</p>
<h3>2.1 Running setup.py</h3>
<p>The simple way of installing <em>Anygui</em> is to use
      the installation script that's included in the
      distribution. This requires <em>Distutils</em>
      (<code><a href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig">http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig</a></code>), which is
      included in <em>Python</em> distributions from version
      2.0. To install the <em>Anygui</em> package in the default
      location, simply run the setup script with the
      <code>install</code> command:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ python setup.py install
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This will install <em>Anygui</em> in your standard
      <em>Python</em> directory structure. If you don't have
      access to this directory (e.g. because <em>Python</em> was
      installed by a sysadmin, and you don't have root access) you can
      install it somewhere else with the <code>--prefix</code>
      option:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/python
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>2.2 Doing it Manually</h3>
<p>Since <em>Anygui</em> consists of only
      <em>Python</em> code, nothing needs to be compiled. And the
      only thing needed to install <em>Python</em> code is to
      ensure that the packages and modules are found by your
      <em>Python</em> interpreter. This is as simple as including
      the <code>lib</code> directory of the <em>Anygui</em>
      distribution in your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment
      variable. In <code>bash</code>
      (<code><a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/">http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/</a></code>), you could do
      something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/anygui/lib
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To make this permanent, you should put it in your
      <code>.bash_profile</code> file, or something equivalent. If you
      don't want to mess around with this, and already have a standard
      directory where you place your <em>Python</em> modules, you
      can simply copy (or move) the <code>anygui</code> package (found
      in <code>anygui-0.2/lib</code>) there, or possibly
      place a symlink in that directory to the <code>anygui</code>
      package.</p>
<h3>2.3 Making Sure You Have a Usable GUI Package</h3>
<p>Once you have <em>Anygui</em> installed, you'll want
      to make sure you have a usable GUI package. This is easy to
      check: Simply start an interactive <em>Python</em>
      interpreter and try to execute the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; backend()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <code>backend</code> function will return the name of
      the backend in use. If it is neither <code>'curses'</code> nor
      <code>'text'</code> you should be all set for making GUI
      programs with <em>Anygui</em>. (The <code>'curses'</code>
      and <code>'text'</code> backends use plain text to emulate
      graphical interfaces on platforms that don't have them.)
      <em>Anygui</em> currently supports the following
      packages:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
PythonWin  (mswgui)    <code><a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32</a></code>
Tkinter    (tkgui)     <code><a href="http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter">http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter</a></code>
wxPython   (wxgui)     <code><a href="http://www.wxpython.org">http://www.wxpython.org</a></code>
Java Swing (javagui)   <code><a href="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a></code>
PyGTK      (gtkgui)    <code><a href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk">http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk</a></code>
Bethon     (beosgui)   <code><a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/1564">http://www.bebits.com/app/1564</a></code>
PyQt       (qtgui)     <code><a href="http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde">http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde</a></code>
Curses     (cursesgui) -- used when no GUI package is available
Plain text (textgui)   -- used if curses is not available
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Add <code>gui</code> to name returned by the
      <code>backend</code> function to get the full name of the
      backend module (in the <code>anygui.backends</code>
      package). For instance, the <code>msw</code> backend is found in
      <code>anygui.backends.mswgui</code> module.</p>
<p>In general, if you end up with a text-based solution,
      <code>cursesgui</code> will be preferred over
      <code>textgui</code>if your <em>Python</em>-installation has
      a wrorking <code>curses</code> module. The exception is if you
      are using <em>Anygui</em> in the interactive interpreter, in
      which <code>textgui</code> will be preferred, to avoid
      interfering with the terminal and locking up the interpreter
      prompt. (If you'd like to, for some reason, you can override
      this behaviour with the environment variable
      <code>ANYGUI_FORCE_CURSES</code>; see the API Reference
      below.)</p>
<p>
<b>BeOS Note:</b> The BeOS backend
      (<code>beosgui</code>) is currently not fully functional, but is
      included nonetheless.</p>
<p>Of these, <em>Tkinter</em> is compiled in by default
      in the <em>MS Windows</em> distribution of
      <em>Python</em> (available from
      <code><a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a></code>), <em>PythonWin</em> (as
      well as <em>Tkinter</em>) is included in the
      <em>ActiveState</em> distribution, <em>ActivePython</em>
      (available from <code><a href="http://www.activestate.com">http://www.activestate.com</a></code>), and
      <em>Java Swing</em> is automatically available in
      <em>Jython</em>, the <em>Java</em> implementation of
      <em>Python</em>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> In <em>Mac OS</em> 9,
      <em>Anygui</em> (using <em>Tkinter</em>) works with with
      <em>Python Classic</em> and recent versions of <em>Python
      Carbon</em>, but older versions have problems with
      <em>Tkinter</em>.</p>
<h2>3. Using Anygui</h2>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: For some examples of working
    <em>Anygui</em> code, see the <code>test</code> and
    <code>demo</code> directories of the distribution. Remember that
    the test scripts are written to test certain features of
    <em>Anygui</em>, not to represent recommended coding
    practices.</p>
<p>Using <em>Anygui</em> is simple; it's simply a matter of
    importing the classes and functions you need from the
    <code>anygui</code> module, e.g.:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After doing this you must create an <code>Application</code>
    object, at least one <code>Window</code>, and probably a few
    components such as <code>Button</code>s and
    <code>TextField</code>s. The <code>Window</code>s are added to the
    <code>Application</code> (through its <code>add</code> method),
    and the various components are added to the
    <code>Window</code>. When you have done this, you call the
    <code>run</code> method of your <code>Application</code>
    instance.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# Make components here
win = Window()
# Add components to the Window
app = Application()
app.add(win)
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.1 Avoiding Namespace Pollution</h3>
<p>Importing everything from <em>Anygui</em> (as in
      <code>from anygui import *</code>) is fine for small programs,
      where you're certain that there will be no name clashes. You may
      also simply import the names you need:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import Application, Window
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The preferred way to use modules like this is usually to
      avoid cluttering your namespace, by using simply
      <code>import anygui</code>. However, if you are going to create a lot of
      widgets, the <code>anygui</code> prefix may be
      cumbersome. Therefore, I suggest renaming it to
      <code>gui</code>, either with a simple assignment...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import anygui; gui = anygui
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>... or, in recent versions of <em>Python</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import anygui as gui
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then you can instantiate widgets like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win = gui.Window()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The examples in this documentation use the starred import,
      for simplicity.</p>
<h3>3.2 Importing the Backends Directly</h3>
<p>If you wish to import a backend directly (and "hardwire
      it" into your program), you may do so. For instance, if you
      wanted to use the <em>wxPython</em> backend,
      <code>wxgui</code>, you'd replace
      </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>with</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui.backends.wxgui import *
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the namespace handling still works just fine:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import anygui.backends.tkgui as gui
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.3 Creating a Window</h3>
<p>One of the most important classes in <em>Anygui</em>
      is <code>Window</code>. Without a <code>Window</code> you have
      no GUI; all the other widgets are added to
      <code>Window</code>s. Knowing this, we may suspect that the
      following is a minimal <em>Anygui</em> program (and we would
      be right):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
app = Application()
win = Window()
app.add(win)
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This example gives us a rather uninteresting default
      window. You may customise it by setting some of its properties,
      like <code>title</code> and <code>size</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w = Window()
w.title = 'Hello, world!'
w.size = (200, 100)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we want to, we can supply the widget properties as
      keyword arguments to the constructor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w = Window(title='Hello, world!', size=(200,100))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.4 The set Method and the Options Class</h3>
<p>If you want to change some attributes of a widget, you can
      either just set them directly, or (if you'd like to set several
      at once), use the <code>set</code> method, just like the
      constructor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w.set(title='Hello, again', size=(300,200))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Supplying the same attributes with the same values to a
      lot of widgets (if you are making several buttons with the same
      size, for instance) can be a bit impractical (you'll learn more
      about buttons in a little while):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
bt1 = Button(left=10, width=50, height=30, text='Button 1')
bt2 = Button(left=10, width=50, height=30, text='Button 2')
bt3 = Button(left=10, width=50, height=30, text='Button 3')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>To deal with this, the widget constructors (and the
      <code>set</code> method) can take <code>Options</code> objects
      as positional parameters:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
opt = Options(left=10, width=50, height=30)
bt1 = Button(opt, text='Button 1')
bt2 = Button(opt, text='Button 2')
bt3 = Button(opt, text='Button 3')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As you can see, this saves quite a lot of typing. You can
      use as many <code>Options</code> arguments as you like.</p>
<h3>3.5 The modify Method</h3>
<p>Just like <code>set</code> can be used to set the
      attributes of a <code>Component</code>, the <code>modify</code>
      method can be used to <em>modify</em> them, without
      rebinding them to another value. To show the difference,
      consider the following example (where <code>foo</code> is an
      attribute that does nothing special):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn = Button()
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo = some_list
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.modify(foo=[4, 5, 6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.set(foo=[7, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo
[7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[4, 5, 6]
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As you can see, using <code>modify</code> modifies the
      list, while <code>set</code> replaces it. The
      <code>modify</code> method is used for (among other things)
      implementing Model-View-Controller systems. (More about that
      later.)</p>
<p>The <code>modify</code> method works as follows: If there
      is a specific internal method for modifying an attribute, that
      is called. Otherwise, the supplied value will be assigned to
      <code>self.name[:]</code> (where <code>name</code> is the
      attribute in question). If that doesn't work (a
      <code>TypeError</code> exception is raised), the value will be
      assigned to <code>self.name.value</code>. If that doesn't work
      either, the attribute will be rebound to the new value, with the
      same result as using <code>set</code>. So, to avoid any in-place
      modification, all you need to do is use immutable values:
      </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn = Button()
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo = tuple(some_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.modify(foo=[4, 5, 6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn.foo
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list
[1, 2, 3]
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.6 The sync Method</h3>
<p>The <code>modify</code> method is used to modify
      attributes in-place, e.g. to keep them in sync with a
      widget. This is done automatically when you change a widget
      through the graphical interface. In a way, the
      <code>sync</code> method works the other way: If you modify an
      attribute, you can call the <code>sync</code> method to keep
      the widget's appearance in sync with its state. When you assign
      to an attribute, <code>sync</code> is called automatically;
      you only have to call it yourself if you have an attribute which
      is a mutable object, and you modify that object.</p>
<p>For more info about the use of <code>sync</code>, see
      the section "About Models, Views, and Controllers",
      below.</p>
<h3>3.7 Adding a Label</h3>
<p>Simple labels are created with the <code>Label</code>
      class:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lab = Label(text='Hello, again!', position=(10,10))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here we have specified a position just for fun; we don't
      really have to. If we add the label to our window, we'll see
      that it's placed with its left topmost corner at the point
      <code>(10,10)</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
w.add(lab)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>3.8 Layout: Placing Widgets in a Frame</h3>
<p>This section goves a simple example of positioning
      <code>Components</code>; for more information about the
      <em>Anygui</em> layout mechanism, please refer to the API
      Reference (below).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.add(lab, position=(10,10))
win.add(lab, left=10, top=10)
win.add(lab, top=10, right=10)
win.add(lab, position=(10,10), right=10, hstretch=1)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the last example <code>hstretch</code> is a Boolean
      value indicating whether the widget should be stretched
      horizontally (to maintain the other specifications) when the
      containing <code>Frame</code> is resized. (The vertical version
      is <code>vstretch</code>.)</p>
<p>Just like in component constructors, you can use
      <code>Options</code> objects in the <code>add</code> method,
      after the component to be added:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.add(lab, opt, left=10)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>3.8.1 Placing More Than One Widget</h4>
<p>The <code>add</code> method can also position a
	<em>sequence</em> of widgets. The first widget
	will be placed as before, while the subsequent ones will be
	placed either to the <code>right</code>, to the
	<code>left</code>, above (<code>up</code>), or below
	(<code>down</code>), according to the <code>direction</code>
	argument, at a given distance (<code>space</code>):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.add((lab1, lab2), position=(10,10),
        direction='right', space=10)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Remember to enclose your
	components in a sequence (such as a tuple or a list), since
	<code>add</code> allows you to use more positional arguments,
	but will treat them differently. If you want to use
	<code>Options</code> objects, place them outside (after) the
	sequence. For more information see the section about the
	<code>Frame</code> class in the API Reference below.</p>
<h3>3.9 Buttons and Event Handling</h3>
<p>
<code>Buttons</code> (as most components) work more or
      less the same way as <code>Labels</code>. You can set their
      <code>size</code>, their <code>position</code>, their
      <code>text</code>, etc. and then <code>add</code> them to a
      <code>Frame</code> (such as a <code>Window</code>). The thing
      that makes them interesting is that they emit
      <em>events</em>. Each time the user clicks a button,
      it sends out a <code>click</code> event. You can catch these
      events by linking your button to one or more <em>event
      handlers</em>. It's really simple:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button(text='Greet Environment')
def greeting(event):
    print 'Hello, World!'
link(btn, greeting)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The event handling is taken care of by the call to
      <code>link</code>. An event handler receives a single
      <code>Event</code> object as its parameter. (For information
      about these, see the API Reference, below.)</p>
<h3>3.10 About Models, Views, and Controllers</h3>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> MVC mechanism (based on the
      <code>sync</code> method and the <code>Assignee</code>
      protocol) is described in the API Reference below. Here is a
      short overview on how to use it.</p>
<p>A <em>model</em> is an object that can be
      modified, and that can notify other objects, called
      <code>views</code>, when it has been modified. A
      <em>controller</em> is an object that can modify the
      model, in particular as a direct response to a user action (such
      as clicking the mouse or typing some text). In
      <em>Anygui</em>, <code>Component</code>s double as both
      views (showing a model's state to the user) and controllers
      (letting the user modify the model). Even though
      <em>Anygui</em> supports using models this way, you can also
      create complete applications without using them (or, at least,
      without thinking about them) .</p>
<p>Models are in general instances of some subclass of the
      <code>Model</code> class, although they don't have to be; see
      the API Reference below for a description of how they work. (The
      <code>Model</code> class is currently internal to the
      <code>Anygui</code> package, but it can be found in the
      <code>anygui.Models</code> module.) The <code>Model</code>s that
      are included in <em>Anygui</em> are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
BooleanModel     -- represents a Boolean value
ListModel        -- behaves like a list
NumberModel      -- represents a numerical value
TextModel        -- acts like a mutable string
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These all have a <code>value</code> attribute which may be
      used to change their internal value. They also support other
      operations, such as indexing and slicing etc. for
      <code>ListModel</code>. These are very easy to use: Just assign
      them to an attribute of a <code>Component</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# You'll learn about CheckBoxes in a minute
cbx = CheckBox(text='Simple model test')
state = BooleanModel(value=1)
cbx.on = state
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, if you change <code>state</code> (e.g. with the
      statement <code>state.value=0</code>) this will automatically be
      reflected in the <code>CheckBox</code> (which will be acting
      like a view). If the user clicks the <code>CheckBox</code>, the
      model will be changed.</p>
<p>To keep a view up-to-date manually you can call its
      <code>sync</code> method. This can be useful if you use a
      simple (non-<code>Model</code>) mutable value such as a list in
      an attribute:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button()
rect = [0, 0, 10, 10]
btn.geometry = rect
rect[3] = 20
btn.sync('geometry')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After modifying <code>rect</code>, the button will not
      have changed, since it can't detect the change by
      itself. (That's only possible when you use a real model.)
      Therefore, you call <code>btn.sync</code> to tell it to update
      itself.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> When modifying either
      <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>,
      <code>height</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>size</code>,
      or <code>geometry</code> in place like this, you should supply
      the name of the attribute as an argument to <code>sync</code>,
      to avoid confusing <em>Anygui</em>. That is because these
      attributes mirror each other in various ways, and if you don't
      supply a name, <em>Anygui</em> won't know which one you
      modified.</p>
<p>If you assign a value to an attribute, the
      <code>sync</code> method will be called automatically, so
      another way of doing the same thing is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button()
rect = [0, 0, 10, 10]
btn.geometry = rect
rect[3] = 20
btn.geometry = rect
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Caution:</b> Because of the controller behaviour
      of <code>Component</code>s, if the <code>Button</code> is
      resized, <code>rect</code> will be modified. If you don't want
      this behaviour, use a tuple instead of a list, since tuples
      can't be modified.</p>
<p>If you want another object to monitor a
      <code>Model</code>, you can simply use the <code>link</code>
      method, since all <code>Model</code>s generate an event (of the
      type <code>default</code>) when they are modified.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl = BooleanModel()
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl.value = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; def model_changed(event):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     print 'The model has changed!'

&gt;&gt;&gt; link(mdl, model_changed)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl.value = 0
The model has changed
&gt;&gt;&gt; mdl.value = 0
The model has changed
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note the last two lines: We haven't really changed the
      model, but the event handler is called nonetheless. If you want
      to know whether the model really changed, you must retain a copy
      of its state, and compare it with the new value.</p>
<h3>3.11 Using CheckBoxes</h3>
<p>A <code>CheckBox</code> is a <em>toggle
      button</em>, a button which can be in one of two states,
      "on" or "off". Except for that, it works more or less like any
      other button in that you can place it, set its text, and
      link an event handler to it.</p>
<p>Whether a <code>CheckBox</code> is currently on or off is
      indicated by its <code>on</code> attribute.</p>
<h3>3.12 RadioButtons and RadioGroups</h3>
<p>
<code>RadioButton</code>s are toggle buttons, just like
      <code>CheckBox</code>es. The main differences are that they look
      slightly different, and that they should belong to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>RadioGroup</code> is a set of
      <code>RadioButton</code>s where only <em>one</em><code>RadioButton</code> is permitted to be "on" at one
      time. Thus, when one of the buttons in the group is turned on,
      the others are automatically turned off. This can be useful for
      selecting among different alternatives.</p>
<p>
<code>RadioButton</code>s are added to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code> by setting their <code>group</code>
      property:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
radiobutton.group = radiogroup
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This may also be done when constructing the button:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
grp = RadioGroup()
rbn = RadioButton(group=grp)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Caution:</b> The behaviour of a
      <code>RadioButton</code> when it does not belong to a
      <code>RadioGroup</code> is not defined by the
      <em>Anygui</em> API, and may vary between
      backends. Basically, a <code>RadioButton</code> without a
      <code>RadioGroup</code> is meaningless; use a
      <code>CheckBox</code> instead.</p>
<p>
<code>RadioGroups</code> also support an <code>add</code>
      method, as all other <em>Anygui</em> container-like
      objects:</p>
<p>
<code><b>add</b></code>(<i>button</i>)</p>
<p>Adds the <i>button</i> to the group, including setting
      <i>button</i><code>.group</code> to the group. As with the
      other <code>add</code> methods, the argument may be either a
      single object, or a sequence of objects.</p>
<h3>3.13 ListBox</h3>
<p>A <code>ListBox</code> is a vertical list of items that
      can be selected, either by clicking on them, or by moving the
      selection up and down with the arrow keys. (For the arrow keys
      to work, you must make sure that the <code>ListBox</code> has
      keyboard focus. In some backends this requires using the
      <code>tab</code> key.)</p>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: When using <em>Anygui</em>
      with <em>Tkinter</em>, using the arrow keys won't change the
      selection, only which item is underlined. You'll have to use the
      arrow keys until the item you want to select is underlined; then
      select it by pressing the space bar.</p>
<p>A <code>ListBox</code>'s items are stored in its attribute
      <code>items</code>, a sequence of arbitrary objects. The
      text displayed in the widget will be the result of applying the
      built-in <em>Python</em> function <code>str</code> to each
      object.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lbx = ListBox()
lbx.items = 'This is a test'.split()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The currently selected item can be queried or set through
      the <code>selection</code> property (an integer index, counting
      from zero). Also, when an item is selected, a
      <code>select</code> event is generated, which is the default
      event type for a <code>ListBox</code>. This means that you can
      either do</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
link(lbx, 'select', handler)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>or</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
link(lbx, handler)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>with the same result. (This is similar to the
      <code>click</code> event, which is default for
      <code>Buttons</code>; for more information, see the API
      Reference below.)</p>
<h3>3.14 TextField and TextArea</h3>
<p>
<em>Anygui</em>'s two text widgets,
      <code>TextField</code> and <code>TextArea</code> are quite
      similar. The difference between them is that
      <code>TextField</code> permits neither newlines or tab
      characters to be typed, while <code>TextArea</code> does. Typing
      a tab in a <code>TextField</code> will simply move the focus to
      another widget, while pressing the enter key will send an
      <code>enterkey</code> event (which is the
      <code>TextField</code>'s default event type).</p>
<p>The text in a text component is stored in its
      <code>text</code> property (a string or equivalent), and the
      current selection is stored in its <code>selection</code>
      property (a tuple of two integer indices).</p>
<h3>3.15 Making Your Own Components and LayoutManagers</h3>
<p>Currently, you can create your own components by combining
      others in <code>Frame</code>s, and wrapping the whole thing up
      as a class. One of the main reasons for doing this would be to
      emulate a feature (such as a tabbed pane) available in some
      backends, but not in others. One could then actually
      <em>use</em> the native version in the backends
      where it is available (such as <code>wx</code>, in this case),
      and use the "emulation" in the others. There is some limited
      support for this in the <code>backend</code> function (which
      will allow you to check whether you are currently using the
      correct backend), but in the future, a more complete API will be
      developed for this, allowing you access to the coolest features
      of your favorite GUI package, while staying "package
      independent".</p>
<p>You can already create your own layout managers, by
      properly supporting the methods <code>add</code>,
      <code>remove</code>, and <code>resized</code>. The simplest way
      of doing this is to subclass <code>LayoutManager</code>, which
      gives you the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> methods
      for free. You can then concentrate on the method
      <code>resized</code> which takes two positional arguments,
      <code>dw</code>, and <code>dh</code> (change in width and change
      in height) and is responsible for changing the geometries of all
      the components in the <code>Frame</code> the
      <code>LayoutManager</code> is managing. (This frame is available
      through the attribute <code>self.container</code>.)
      </p>
<p>To get more control over things, you should probably also
      override the two internal methods <code>internalAdd</code>
      and <code>internalRemove</code>:</p>
<p>
<code>internalAdd</code>(self, *<i>items</i>,
      **<i>kws</i>)</p>
<p>Should add all the components in <i>items</i>, and
      associate them with the options in <code>kws</code>, for later
      resizing.</p>
<p>
<code>internalRemove</code>(self,
      <i>item</i>)</p>
<p>Should remove the given item.</p>
<h3>3.16 More Stuff</h3>
<p>More stuff to come... See the API reference.</p>
<h2>4. API Reference</h2>
<p>The following reference will describe the full official API of
  the current version (0.2) of <em>Anygui</em> but is
  currently under development.</p>
<h3>4.1 Environment Variables</h3>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>The environment variables may be
    renamed, and their use may be deprecated. Use the
    <code>setup</code> function instead.</p>
<p>Some environment variables affect the behaviour of the
    <em>Anygui</em> package. These must be set in the environment
    of the program using <em>Anygui</em>. They may either be set
    permanently through normal operating system channels (check your
    OS documentation for this), or possibly just set temporarily when
    running your program. In <em>Unix</em> shells like
    <em>bash</em>, you can set the variables on the command line
    before your comand, like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ ANYGUI_SOMEVAR='some value' python someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>where <code>ANYGUI_SOMEVAR</code> is some environment
    variable used by <em>Anygui</em>.</p>
<p>Since <em>Jython</em> doesn't support OS environment
    variables, you'll have to supply them with the command-line switch
    <code>-D</code>: </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ jython -DANYGUI_SOMEVAR='some value' someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can also set these environment variables in your own
    program, by using code like the following before you import
    <em>Anygui</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
import os
os.environ['ANYGUI_SOMEVAR'] = 'some value'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This will probably not work well in <em>Jython</em>, though.</p>
<p>The environment variables used by <em>Anygui</em>
    are:</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code>: A whitespace separated list of
    backend names in the order you wish for <em>Anygui</em> to try
    to use them. The backends are identified with a short prefix such
    as <code>wx</code> for <code>wxgui</code>, or <code>tk</code> for
    <code>tkgui</code>. For a full list of available backends, see the
    section "Making Sure You Have a GUI Backend" above. Only the
    backends in this list will be tried; if you don't set
    <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code>, then the following is the
    default:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
'msw gtk java wx tk beos qt curses text'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you insert an asterisk in the wishlist, it will be
    interpreted as "the rest of the backends, in default order". So,
    for instance,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
ANYGUI_WISHLIST='tk wx * text curses'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
ANYGUI_WISHLIST='tk wx msq gtk java beos qt text curses'
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ ANYGUI_WISHLIST='tk wx qt' python someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_DEBUG</code>: When <em>Anygui</em> tries to
    import a backend, it hides all exceptions, assuming they are
    caused by the fact that a given backend doesn't work in your
    installation (because you don't have it installed or something
    similar). However, at times this may not be the reason; it may
    simple be that a given backend contains a bug. To track down the
    bug, set the <code>ANYGUI_DEBUG</code> to some true (in a
    <em>Python</em> sense) value. (If the value supplied can be
    converted to an integer, it will. Otherwise, it will be treated as
    a string.) This will make <em>Anygui</em> print out the stack
    traces from each backend it tries to import.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this rule: If the true value
    supplied is the name of one of the backends (such as
    <code>tk</code> or <code>curses</code>) only the traceback caused
    by importing that backend will be shown. This can be useful to
    make the output somewhat less verbose.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
foo:~$ ANYGUI_DEBUG=1 python someprogram.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_ALTERNATE_BORDER</code>: This Boolean variable
    affects <code>cursesgui</code>, making it use the same
    border-drawing characters as <code>textgui</code>
    (<code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, and <code>'|'</code>). This
    may be useful if your terminal can't show the special
    <code>curses</code> box-drawing characters properly.</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_SCREENSIZE</code>: Affects
    <code>textgui</code>. Gives the terminal ("screen") dimensions, in
    characters. This should be in the format
    <i>width</i><code>x</code><i>height</i>,
    e.g. <code>80x24</code>. If this environment variable is not
    supplied, the standard <em>Unix</em> variables
    <code>COLUMNS</code> and <code>LINES</code> will be used. If
    neither is provided, the default size <code>80x23</code> will be
    used.</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_FORCE_CURSES</code>: Normally,
    <code>cursesgui</code> will not be selected if you are in the
    interactive interpreter. If you want to force the normal selection
    order (trying to use <code>cursesgui</code> before resorting to
    <code>textgui</code>) you can set this variable to a true
    value. Note that this is not the same as setting
    <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code> to <code>'curses'</code>, since that
    will ignore all other backends.</p>
<p>
<code>ANYGUI_CURSES_NOHELP</code>: If you don't want the
    help-screen that appears when an <em>Anygui</em> application
    is started using <code>cursesgui</code> (or <code>textgui</code>),
    you can set this variable to a true value.</p>
<h3>4.2 Global Functions</h3>
<p>
<code><b>application</b></code>()</p>
<p>Returns the current <code>Application</code>
    object.</p>
<p>
<code><b>backend</b></code>()</p>
<p>Returns the name (as used in <code>ANYGUI_WISHLIST</code>)
    of the backend currently in use.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
if backend() == 'wx':
    some_wx_code()
else:
    some_generic_code()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code><b>link</b></code>(<i>source</i>,
    [<i>event</i>,] <i>handler</i>, <i>weak</i>=0,
    <i>loop</i>=0)</p>
<p>Creates a link in the <em>Anygui</em> event system,
    between the <code>source</code> (any object) and the
    <code>handler</code> (any callable, or a <code>(obj,func)</code>
    pair, where <code>func</code> is an unbound method or function,
    and <code>obj</code> is an object which will be supplied as the
    first parameter to <code>func</code>). Supplying an
    <code>event</code> (a string) will make the link carry only
    information about events of that type. If no event is supplied,
    <code>'default'</code> will be assumed. Setting <code>weak</code>
    to a true value will use weak references when setting up the link,
    so that no objects will be "kept alive" by the link.</p>
<p>A send-loop occurs if an object sends an event "to itself"
    (i.e. it is the <code>source</code> argument of a call to
    <code>send</code> which hasn't returned at the point where one of
    its methods are about to be activated as a handler). The truth
    value <code>loop</code> decides whether this handler will be
    activated in such a loop. (If <code>send</code> was called with
    <code>loop=1</code>, loops will be allowed anyway.)
    </p>
<p>Note that <code>source</code>, <code>event</code>, and
    <code>handler</code> are strictly positional parameters, while the
    others (<code>weak</code>, and <code>loop</code>) must be supplied
    as keyword parameters.</p>
<p>Sometimes one might want an event handler that reacts to a
    specific event from <em>any</em> source, or
    <em>any</em> event from a specific source; or even
    <em>any</em> event from <em>any</em>
    source. To do that, simply use the special value <code>any</code>
    as either source, event, or both.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
from anygui import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; def monitor_events(event):
...     print 'An event occurred:', event.event
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; link(any, any, monitor_events)
&gt;&gt;&gt; btn = Button()
&gt;&gt;&gt; send(btn, 'foobar')
An event occurred: foobar
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you use <code>send(btn, 'click')</code> in this example,
    you will get <em>two</em> events, since the
    <code>Button</code> will detect the <code>click</code> event
    (which is its default), and issue a <code>default</code> event as
    well.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> You need to explicitly supply the
    event type if you want to respond to any event type; otherwise you
    will only respond to the <code>default</code> type.</p>
<p>Event handlers that react to the same event will be called
    in the order they were registered (with <code>link</code>),
    subject to the following: (1) All handlers registered with a
    specific source will be called before handlers with the value
    <code>any</code> as source; (2) all handlers registered with a
    specific event (including <code>default</code>) are called before
    handlers with the value <code>any</code> as event.</p>
<p>For more information on sending events, see
    <code>send</code>, below.</p>
<p>
<code><b>send</b></code>(<i>source</i>,
    <i>event</i>=<code>'default'</code>, <i>loop</i>=0,
    **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>When this is called, any handlers (callables) linked to the
    source, but which will not cause a send-loop (unless
    <code>loop</code> is true) will be called with an
    <code>Event</code> object which stores all the keyword arguments
    provided (except <code>loop</code>), in the order in which they
    were linked. In addition to the supplied keyword arguments, the
    event framework will add <code>source</code>, <code>event</code>,
    and the time (as measured by the standard <em>Python</em>
    function <code>time.time</code>) when <code>send</code> was
    called, supplied with the <code>time</code> argument.</p>
<p>The <code>Event</code> object is simly a "bunch" object,
    with each keyword argument stored as an attribute.</p>
<p>Note that <code>source</code>, and <code>event</code>, are
    strictly positional parameters, while the others
    (<code>loop</code>, and any additional arguments the user might
    add) must be supplied as keyword parameters.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# Link an event handler to a button, and then manually send a
# default event from the button. This event would have been
# sent automatically if we clicked the button.

def click(event):
    source = event.source
    time = event.time
    print 'Button %s clicked at %f.' % (source.text, event.time)

btn = Button(text='Click me')
link(btn, click)

send(btn) # Fake a button click -- will call click()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For information about the order in which event handlers are
    called, see <code>link</code>, above.</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> Due to the current semantics of
    the <code>any</code> value, using it in <code>send</code> may not
    be a good idea, since the result might not be what you expect. For
    instance, calling <code>send(any, any)</code> will only activate
    event handlers which have been linked to the value
    <code>any</code> as both source and event, not to "event handlers
    with any source and any event". This may change in future
    releases. The current behaviour of <code>send</code> with
    <code>any</code> is consistent with <code>unlink</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlink</b></code>(<i>source</i>,
    [<i>event</i>,] <i>handler</i>)</p>
<p>Undoes a call to <code>link</code> with the same positional
    arguments. If <i>handler</i> has been registered with either
    <i>source</i> or <i>event</i> as <code>any</code>, that
    parameter will be irrelevant when deciding whether or not to
    remove that link. For instance:
    </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
link(foo, any, bar)
unlink(foo, baz, bar)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here the link created by <code>link(foo, any, bar)</code>
    will be removed by the call to <code>unlink</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This behaviour (unlinking handlers
    registered with the <code>any</code> value) may change in future
    releases.</p>
<p>
<b>Default Events</b>: When used without the event
    argument, both <code>link</code> and <code>send</code> use an
    event type called <code>default</code>. Most event-generating
    components have a default event type, such as <code>click</code>
    for <code>Button</code>s. The fact that this event type is default
    for <code>Button</code> means that when a <code>Button</code>
    generates a <code>click</code> event it will
    <em>also</em> generate a <code>default</code>
    event. So, if you listen to both <code>click</code> events and
    <code>default</code> events from a <code>Button</code>, your event
    handler will always be called twice.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlinkHandler</b></code>(<i>handler</i>)</p>
<p>Removes a handler completely from the event
    framework.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlinkMethods</b></code>(<i>obj</i>)</p>
<p>Unlinks all handlers that are methods of
    <code>obj</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>unlinkSource</b></code>(<i>source</i>)</p>
<p>Remove the source (and all handlers linked to it) from the
    event framework.</p>
<h3>4.3 Classes</h3>
<p>
<b>Base Classes and Common Behaviour</b>
</p>
<p>All components are subclasses the base class
    <code>Component</code>, which means that they all share some
    common behaviour.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important behaviour is attribute handling
    (inherited from the <code>Attrib</code> mixin), which means that
    setting a components attributes may trigger some internal method
    calls. For instance,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win.size = 300, 200
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>will automatically resize the component
    <code>win</code>. Attributes common to all components are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
x         -- x-coordinate of upper left corner
y         -- y-coordinate of upper left corner
position  -- equivalent to (x, y)
width     -- component width
height    -- component height
size      -- equivalent to (width, height)
geometry  -- equivalent to (x, y, width, height)
visible   -- whether the component is visible
enabled   -- whether the component is enabled
text      -- text associated with the component
container -- the containing component
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These can all be set as keyword arguments to the component
    constructors. Also, <code>Options</code> objects (with similar
    constructors) can be used as positional arguments in the
    constructor, with all the <code>Options</code>'s attributes being
    set in the component as well.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The <code>container</code> attribute
    will rarely be set directly, but rather implicitly by using the
    containing component's <code>add</code> method.</p>
<p>Common to <code>Application</code>, <code>Window</code>, and
    <code>Frame</code> are the <code>add</code> and
    <code>remove</code> methods. These will be described with the
    individual classes below.</p>
<p>All <code>Attrib</code> subclasses (including components,
    <code>Application</code>, and <code>RadioGroup</code>) share the
    following methods:</p>
<p>
<code><b>set</b></code>(*<i>args</i>, **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>Used to set attributes. Works like the <code>Attrib</code>
    constructor, setting attributes, and optionally using
    <code>Options</code> objects.</p>
<p>There is a variant called <code>rawSet</code> which does
    not call <code>sync</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>modify</b></code>(*<i>args</i>, **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>Works like the <code>set</code> method, except that the
    attributes are modified <em>in place</em>. That means
    the following (for an attribute named <code>foo</code>): (1) try
    to use slice assignment to change the value (will work for lists
    and <code>ListModels</code> etc.); if that doesn't work, (2)
    assign to the value's <code>value</code> attribute (used to modify
    <code>Model</code>s). If neither of these approaches work, simply
    rebind the attribute (equivalent to using the <code>set</code>
    method).</p>
<p>As with <code>set</code> and ordinary attribute assignment,
    the <code>sync</code> method will automatically be called when you
    use <code>modify</code>.</p>
<p>There is a variant called <code>rawModify</code> which does
    not call <code>sync</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>sync</b></code>(*<i>names</i>)</p>
<p>When an attribute of a <code>Component</code> (or
    <code>Application</code>, <code>RadioGroup</code>, or an instance
    of another <code>Attrib</code> subclass) is assigned a value, the
    <code>Component</code> is automatically updated to reflect its new
    state. For instance, if you have a <code>Label</code><code>lbl</code>, assigning a value to <code>lbl.geometry</code>
    would immediately change the <code>Label</code>'s geometry, and
    assigning to <code>lbl.text</code> would change its text.</p>
<p>This is good enough for most cases, but sometimes an
    attribute can contain a mutable value, such as a list, and
    changing that will not update the <code>Component</code>. For
    instance, if you use a list to hold the <code>items</code> of a
    <code>ListBox</code>, you could end up in the following
    situation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lbx = ListBox()
lbx.items = 'first second third'.split()
# More code...
lbx.items.append('fourth')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After performing this code, nothing will have happened to
    the <code>ListBox</code>, because it has no way of knowing that
    the list has changed. To fix that, you can simply call its
    <code>sync</code> method:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
lbx.sync()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This method checks whether any attributes have changed,
    and make sure that the <code>Component</code> us up to
    date.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can supply the name(s) of the attribute(s)
    which have changed. Usually this is just an optimisation (which
    may be used by some backends to avoid unnecessary updates), but in
    one particular case it is very important: When modifying either
    <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>,
    <code>height</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>size</code>, or
    <code>geometry</code>. <code>Component</code>s automatically
    synchronise these geometric attributes, but since these depend on
    each other, you need to specify which one(s) you have
    modified.</p>
<p>For instance, the following will confuse <em>Anygui</em>
    and will raise an exception:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn.geometry = [10, 10, 50, 50]
btn.geometry[1] += 1
btn.sync()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first line is fine, since it will automatically lead to
    an internal call to <code>btn.sync('geometry')</code>. The last
    line, however, will have <em>Anygui</em> trying to synchronise
    <code>btn.geometry</code>, <code>btn.position</code>, and
    <code>btn.y</code> without knowing which one was modified. It
    refuses to guess, and raises an exception. This could be solved by
    changing the last line to:
    </p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn.sync('geometry')
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Updating Automatically</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The following section is not
    currently correct.</p>
<p>Updating <code>Components</code> explicitly can be useful,
    but sometimes you would want it to be done for you, automatically,
    each time you modify an object that is referred to by a
    <code>Component</code> attribute. This can be taken care of by
    <code>link</code> and <code>send</code>. If your object uses
    <code>send</code> every time it's modified, and you
    <code>link</code> the object to your <code>Component</code>'s
    <code>sync</code> method, things will happen by themselves:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
class TriggerList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []
    def append(self, obj):
        self.list.append(obj)
        send(self)
    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.list[i]

lbx = ListBox()
lbx.items = TriggerList()
link(lbx.items, lbx.sync)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, if we call <code>lbx.items.append('fourth')</code>,
    <code>lbx.sync</code> will automatically be called. To make your
    life easier, <em>Anygui</em> already contains some classes
    that send signals whend they are modified; these classes are
    called <code>Model</code>s.</p>
<p>
<b>Model and Assignee</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The following section is not
    currently correct.</p>
<p>The <em>Anygui</em> models (<code>BooleanModel</code>,
    <code>ListModel</code>, <code>TextModel</code>, and
    <code>NumberModel</code>) are objects that call <code>send</code>
    (with the <code>'default'</code> event) when they are
    modified.</p>
<p>An <code>Assignee</code> (part of the <em>Anygui</em>
    Model-View-Controller mechanism) is an object that supports the
    methods <code>assigned</code> and <code>removed</code>. These are
    automatically called (if present) when the object is assigned to
    one of the attributes of an <code>Attrib</code> object (such as a
    <code>Component</code>). <code>Model</code>s use this behaviour to
    automatically call <code>link</code> and <code>unlink</code>, so
    when the <code>Model</code> is modified, the <code>sync</code>
    method of the <code>Attrib</code> object is called
    automatically.</p>
<p>All models have a <code>value</code> attribute, which
    contains a "simple" version of its state (such as a number for
    <code>NumberModel</code>, a list for <code>ListModel</code>, etc.)
    Assigning to this attribute is a simple way of modifying the model
    in place.</p>
<p>
<b>class Application</b>
</p>
<p>To instantiate <code>Window</code>s, you must have an
    <code>Application</code> to manage them. You typically instantiate
    an application at the beginning of your program:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
app = Application()
# Build GUI and run application
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In some cases subclassing <code>Application</code> might be
    a useful way of structuring your program, but it is in no way
    required.</p>
<p>
<code>Application</code> has the following methods:</p>
<p>
<code><b>run</b></code>()</p>
<p>Starts the main event loop of the graphical user
    interface. Usually called at the end of the program which set up
    the interface:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
app = Application()
# Set up interface
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code><b>add</b></code>(<i>win</i>)</p>
<p>Adds a <code>Window</code> to the <code>Application</code>,
    in the same way <code>Components</code> can be added to
    <code>Frame</code>s (see below). A <code>Window</code> will not be
    visible until it has been <code>add</code>ed to the current
    <code>Application</code> object, and that <code>Application</code>
    is running. When constructing new <code>Window</code>s after
    <code>Application.run</code> has been called, you should ensure
    that you <code>add</code> your <code>Window</code> to your running
    <code>Application</code> after all the <code>Components</code>
    have been added to your <code>Window</code>; otherwise, you may
    see them appearing and moving about as <em>Anygui</em> takes
    care of the layout. (Before <code>Application.run</code> is
    called, this is not an issue, since no <code>Window</code>s will
    be appear before that time.)</p>
<p>The parameter <code>win</code> can be either a single
    <code>Window</code>, or a sequence of <code>Windows</code>.</p>
<p>
<code><b>remove</b></code>(<i>win</i>)</p>
<p>Removes a <code>Window</code> from the application. This
    will make the <code>Window</code> disappear.</p>
<p>
<b>class Button</b>
</p>
<p>A component which, when pressed, generate a
    <code>'click'</code> event, as well as a <code>'default'</code>
    event. Thus, in the following example, both <code>handler1</code>
    and <code>handler2</code> will be called when the button is
    pressed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
btn = Button()
def handler1(event): print 'Handler 1'
def handler2(event): print 'Handler 2'
link(btn, 'click', handler1)
link(btn, handler2)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>class CheckBox</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>CheckBox</code> is a kind of button, and thus will
    also generate <code>'click'</code> and <code>'default'</code>
    events when clicked. But in addition, each <code>CheckBox</code>
    has a Boolean attribute <code>on</code>, which is toggled each
    time the box is clicked. The state of the <code>CheckBox</code>
    can be altered by assigning to this attribute.</p>
<p>The <code>on</code> property will be automatically modified
    (as per the MVC mechanism) when the user clicks the
    <code>CheckBox</code>. This will also cause the
    <code>CheckBox</code> to <code>send</code> a <code>click</code>
    and a <code>default</code>event.</p>
<p>The <code>on</code> attribute is a useful place to use a
    <code>BooleanModel</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>class Frame</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>Frame</code> is a component which can contain other
    components. Components are added to the <code>Frame</code> with
    the <code>add</code> method:</p>
<p>
<code><b>add</b></code>(<i>comp</i>, [<i>opts</i>,] **<i>kwds</i>)</p>
<p>Adds one or more components. The parameter <code>comp</code>
    may be either a single component, or a sequence of components. In
    the latter case, all the components will be added.</p>
<p>The <code>opts</code> parameter containes an
    <code>Options</code> object (see below) which gives information
    about how the object should be laid out. These options can be
    overridden with keyword arguments, and all this information will
    be passed to the <code>LayoutManager</code> (see below) of the
    <code>Frame</code>, if any. This <code>LayoutManager</code> is
    stored in the <code>layout</code> property.</p>
<p>
<code><b>remove</b></code>(<i>comp</i>)</p>
<p>Removes a component from the <code>Frame</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>class Label</b>
</p>
<p>A <code>Label</code> is a simple component which displays a
    string of text. (<code>Label</code> can only handle one line of
    text.)</p>
<p>
<b>class LayoutManager</b>
</p>
<p>A layout manager is responsible for setting the
    <code>geometry</code> properties of a set of components when their
    parent <code>Frame</code> changes shape. The default
    <code>LayoutManager</code> is the <code>Placer</code> (see below).
    </p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Other <code>LayoutManager</code>s
    will be documented later.</p>
<p>
<b>class ListBox</b>
</p>
<p>Shows a list of options, of which one may be selected. The
    <code>ListBox</code> has two special attributes:
    <code>items</code>, a sequence of items to display, and
    <code>selection</code>, the currently selected (as an index in the
    <code>items</code> sequence).</p>
<p>The <code>selection</code> property will be automatically
    modified (as per the MVC mechanism) when the user makes a
    selection. This will also cause the <code>ListBox</code> to
    <code>send</code> a <code>select</code> and a
    <code>default</code>event.</p>
<p>
<b>class Model</b>
</p>
<p>See the section on <code>Model</code> and
    <code>Assignee</code> above.</p>
<p>
<b>class Options</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>Options</code> is a very simple class. It is simply
    used to store a bunch of named values; basically a dictionary with
    a different syntax. (For more information about the
    <em>bunch</em> class, see
    <code><a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52308">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52308</a></code>.)</p>
<p>You can set the attributes of an <code>Options</code> object
    and then supply it as an optional first parameter to the
    constructors of widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
opt = Options()
opt.width = 100
opt.height = 50
opt.x = 10
btn = Button(opt, y=10)
lbl = Label(opt, y=70)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here <code>btn</code> and <code>lbl</code> will have the
    same <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>x</code>
    attributes, but differing <code>y</code> attributes.</p>
<p>You can also set the attributes of an <code>Options</code>
    object through its constructur, just like with components:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
opt = Options(width=100, height=50, x=10)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>Options</code> objects can also be used when
    supplying arguments to the <code>add</code> method of
    <code>Frame</code>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
# Assuming a Placer LayoutManager:
opt = Options(left=10, right=10, hstretch=1)
win.add(lbl, opt, top=10)
win.add(btn, opt, top=(lbl,10))
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>class Placer</b>
</p>
<p>A simple but powerful layout manager. When adding components
    to a <code>Frame</code> whose <code>layout</code> attribute is set
    to a <code>Placer</code>, you can supply the following keyword
    arguments:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
left         -- the Component's left edge
right        -- the Component's right edge
top          -- the Component's top edge
bottom       -- the Component's bottom edge
hmove        -- move horizontally on resize
vmove        -- move vertically on resize
hstretch     -- stretch horizontally on resize
vstretch     -- stretch vertically on resize
direction    -- 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'
space        -- spacing between multiple Components
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The geometry specifiers (<code>left</code>,
    <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>bottom</code>) can
    be set to either <code>None</code> (the default; will use the
    <code>Component</code>'s existing coordinates), a distance (from
    the corresponding <code>Frame</code> edge), a
    <code>Component</code> (will align the edge with the opposite edge
    of the given component), or a tuple
    (<em>component</em>, <em>distance</em>)
    (as with only a <code>Component</code>, except that a gap of size
    <em>distance</em> is inserted between the two).</p>
<p>The movement arguments (<code>hmove</code> and
    <code>vmove</code>) specify (with a Boolean value) whether the
    <code>Component</code> should be moved (horizontally, vertically,
    or both) to maintain the given distance to the surrounding
    <code>Frame</code>'s edges; the stretching arguments
    (<code>hstretch</code> and <code>vstretch</code>) specify whether
    the <code>Component</code> may be stretched to maintain these
    distances.</p>
<p>
<b>class RadioButton</b>
</p>
<p>A <code>RadioButton</code> is a toggle button, just like
    <code>CheckBox</code>, with slightly different appearance, and
    with the difference that it belongs to a
    <code>RadioGroup</code>. Only one <code>RadioButton</code> can be
    active (have its <code>on</code> attribute be a true Boolean
    value)in the <code>RadioGroup</code> at one time, so when one is
    clicked or programmatically turned on, the others are
    automatically switched off by the <code>RadioGroup</code>. Each
    <code>RadioButton</code> also has a <code>value</code> attribute,
    which should be unique within its <code>RadioGroup</code>. When
    one <code>RadioButton</code> is active, the <code>value</code>
    attribute of its <code>RadioGroup</code> is automatically set to
    that of the active <code>RadioButton</code>. The
    <code>RadioGroup</code> of a <code>RadioButton</code> is set by
    assigning the <code>RadioGroup</code> to the <code>group</code>
    attribute of the <code>RadioButton</code>. Setting the
    <code>value</code> attribute of the <code>RadioGroup</code> will
    automatically activate the correct
    <code>RadioButton</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>class RadioGroup</b>
</p>
<p>See <code>RadioButton</code> above.</p>
<p>
<b>class TextArea</b>
</p>
<p>A multiline text-editing <code>Component</code>. Its text is
    stored in the <code>text</code> attribute, which will be modified
    (according to the MVC mechanism) when the component loses
    focus. It also supports the Boolean <code>editable</code>
    property, which may be used to control whether the user can edit
    the text area or not.</p>
<p>
<b>class TextField</b>
</p>
<p>A one-line text-editing <code>Component</code>. (See also
    <code>TextArea</code>, above.) If the enter/return key is pressed
    within a <code>TextField</code>, the <code>TextField</code> will
    <code>send</code> a <code>enterkey</code> event.</p>
<p>
<b>class Window</b>
</p>
<p>A window, plain and simple. <code>Window</code> is a type of
    <code>Frame</code>, so you can add components to it and set its
    <code>layout</code> property etc. To make your window appear, you
    must remember to add it to your <code>Application</code>, just
    like you add other components to <code>Frame</code>s and
    <code>Window</code>s:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre class="verbatim">
win = Window()
app = Application()
app.add(win)
app.run()
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
<code>Window</code>s have a <code>title</code> attribute
    which may be used by the operating system or window
    manager to identify the window to the user in various ways.</p>

<h2>7. Contributing</h2>
<p>If you want to contribute to the <em>Anygui</em>
    project, we could certainly use your help. First of all, you
    should visit the <em>Anygui</em> web site at
    <code><a href="http://www.anygui.org">http://www.anygui.org</a></code>, subscribe to the developer's mailing
    list (<code>devel@anygui.org</code>) and the user's list
    (<code>users@anygui.org</code>), and try to familiarise yourself
    with how the package works behind the scenes. Then, you may either
    help develop the currently supported GUI packages, or you may
    start writing a backend of your own. Several potential backend
    targets may be found at
    <code><a href="http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html">http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/comp.lang.python/python_GUI.html</a></code>.
