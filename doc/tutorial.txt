1. Introduction

   Anygui is a GUI package for Python that lets you write GUI programs
   that will run in any Python installation, using the available
   backend packages (such as Tkinter or wxPython) and resort to
   text-based GUI emulation (using curses or plain standard
   input/output) when no known GUI backend is available.

   This tutorial will show you how to use Anygui to build a simple
   application which has a single window with a text field and a
   button.  Pressing the button will insert a random sentence into the
   text field.

   To follow this tutorial, you'll need a Python interpreter and the
   latest Anygui distribution. Python can be downloaded from the
   Python website[1] and Anygui can be downloaded from the Anygui
   website[2].

2. Creating Random Sentences

   Before we make the GUI, we'll need some functionality. Let's keep
   it simple:

      from random import choice

      nouns = ['can of spam', 'cardinal', 'machine that goes "ping"']
      adjectives = ['big', 'little', 'pink', 'tasty']
      verbs = ['ate', 'got', 'imitated']

      def sentence():
          words = ['the',
	           choice(adjectives),
	           choice(nouns),
		   choice(verbs),
		   'the',
		   choice(adjectives),
		   choice(nouns)]
          return ' '.join(words)

   To customise this, simply edit the word lists to taste. With the
   current setup, it works like this:

      >>> sentence()
      'the big cardinal got the tasty machine that goes "ping"'

3. Creating a Window and Running the Application

   Now we need an application with a single window. How do we do that?
   It's really intuitive:

      from anygui import *
      
      win = Window()
      app = Application()
      app.add(win)

   There; we've created a Window object, an Application object, and
   added the Window to the Application (otherwise it wouldn't show up
   anywhere).

   This won't do anything by itself; we need to tell the Application
   to start running, which will "freeze" the script and start up a
   GUI:

      app.run()
      print "We're done!"

   I just added the print statement to show how this works. If you run
   the script, you will see that an empty window appears, and that's
   about it. But when you close that window, the Application stops
   running the GUI, and the run() method will return, and finally the
   program will print "We're done!"

4. Adding a Button and a TextField

   Now that you've seen me add a Window to the Application, I'm sure
   you can guess how to add a Button and a TextField to the Window,
   but I'll show you anyway:

      btn = Button()
      win.add(btn)
      
      txt = TextField()
      win.add(txt)

   Nothing fancy here. However, if you actually use this code, you'll
   probably notice a two things:

     1. The button will simply be called "Button"

     2. The positioning will be really stupid

   So what do we do to change that?

5. Attributes

   The clue to customising objects in Anygui is attributes. Most
   properties of any object can be modified simply by setting an
   attribute; for instance, to set the text of our Button object, we
   can simply do

      btn.text = 'Click Me'

   Simple, huh? Similarly, we can set the components' size and
   position:

      btn.x = 10
      btn.y = 10
      btn.width = win.width - 20

      txt.x = 10
      txt.y = btn.height + 20
      txt.width = btn.width

   Similarly we could set the window size and position etc. Feel free
   to experiment to make the application look more sensible.

   There are a few shortcuts that makes specifying position and
   geometry a bit easier:

      btn.geometry = x, y, width, height

   is equivalent to setting x, y, width, height separately; similarly
   we have

      btn.position = x, y

   and
   
      btn.size = width, height

   If you don't want to set all the attributes separately, you can
   also supply them as keyword arguments to the object's constructor:

      btn = Button(text='Click Me', x=10, y=10, ...)

6. Advanced Layout

   Specifying the size and position of the components can be a bit
   tedious, but it is also a technique with one serious limitation: If
   you resize the window, the components' geometry won't change. To

   To use a layout manager, simply assign it to a Window's layout
   attribute:

      win.layout = SomeLayoutManager()

   The default layout manager is Placer, and we'll only look at that
   here (which means that you can leave your Window's layout property
   alone).

   (Note: Layout managers can be used with any Frame, not just
   Windows. Frames in general aren't discussed in this tutorial.)

   To give the layout manager something to work with, simply use some
   keyword arguments in the add method. You can combine this with
   setting the component geometry in any way you like; the layout
   manager simply updates the geometry when the surrounding Window (or
   Frame) is resized.

   Let's say we want the following placement:

     1. The text field is placed on top, with a 10 point margin

     2. The text field should be resized to fill the window
	horizontally

     3. The button should have a fixed size, but be moved to keep it
	10 points from the right edge of the window

   We can do that like this:

      win.add(txt, top=10, left=10, right=10, hstretch=1)

   Here we are simply telling the layout manager that the top, left,
   and right margins (the distance to the surrounding window) of the
   text field should be set to 10, and that the text field should be
   stretched horizontally (hstretch) to keep these margins. (There is
   also a vstretch argument for vertical stretching.)

   The button is placed like this:

      win.add(btn, top=(txt,10), right=10, hmove=1)

   Here we say that it should be positioned with its top 10 points
   below the text field by setting top to the tuple (txt,10). We also
   say that it should be positioned 10 points from the right edge of
   the window, and that it should be moved horizontally to keep that
   distance (hmove=1).

   Try it out. Change it and see what happend. Oh, yeah; there is also
   a keyword argument called bottom <wink>.

   (Note: TextField is meant to contain a single line of text and
   therefore isn't meant to be resized vertically. If you want to
   experiment with vstretch, you could use TextArea instead, which is
   meant to contain arbitrary text.)

7. Handling Events

   When certain events occur, Anygui may send a signal to your program
   which you can choose to react to. (We also call this "sending an
   event".)

   For instance, when the user clicks a button, an event of the type
   'click' is sent automatically, with the button as the source. To
   respond to it, you just have to write a function (or method)
   containing the action to be performed (called the "event handler")
   and link it to the button:

      def handler(**kw):
          txt.text = sentence()

      link(btn, 'click', handler)

   Here we have explicitly said that the handler should be called when
   an event of type 'click' occurs. This is the default event type of
   buttons, which means that we could also have used the type called
   'default', like this:

      link(btn, 'default', handler)

   The nice thing about this is that 'default' always can be omitted,
   so we just write:

      link(btn, handler)

   Try it; when you click the button, the text field will be filled
   with a random sentence. Click it again, and a new sentence appears.
   Cool, huh?

   (Note: Event handlers receive information about the event through
   keyword arguments, such as event type, the time when the event
   occurred etc. We simply ignore all that here, using the **kw syntax
   to allow any keywords.)

9. Further Exploration

   After this short tutorial you should be able to write quite complex
   Anygui programs. To aid you in your exploration here is some more
   information:

   Common attributes:
   
      x             -- x-coordinate of upper left corner
      y             -- y-coordinate of upper left corner
      position      -- equivalent to (x, y)
      width         -- component width
      height        -- component height
      size          -- equivalent to (width, height)
      geometry      -- equivalent to (x, y, width, height)
      visible       -- whether the component is visible
      enabled       -- whether the component is enabled
      text          -- text associated with the component

  Some component types (and additional attributes and methods):

      Button        -- clickable button
      
      CheckBox      -- toggle button
      cbx.on        -- the state of the CheckBox

      Frame         -- "container" for other components
      frm.add()     -- similar to win.add()

      Label         -- a simple one-line text label

      ListBox       -- selectable list of strings
      lbx.items     -- the items in the ListBox
      lbx.selection -- the currently selected item

      RadioButton   -- a toggle button (should be in a RadioGroup)
      rbn.group     -- the RadioGroup of the RadioButton

      RadioGroup    -- group of RadioButtons
      grp.add()     -- used for adding RadioButtons

      TextArea      -- multiline text component
      txt.selection -- tuple (start, end) containing selection

      TextField     -- single-line text component
      txt.selection -- tuple (start, end) containing selection

      Window        -- a top-level window
      win.title     -- the title of the window

   btn = Button(text='Click Me')
   txt = TextField()

   win.add(txt, top=10, left=10, right=10, hstretch=1)
   win.add(btn, top=(txt,10), right=10, hmove=1)

   win.height = txt.height + btn.height + 30

   def handler(**kw): txt.text = sentence()
   link(btn, 'click', handler)

   app = Application()
   app.add(win)
   app.run()
